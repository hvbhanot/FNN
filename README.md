# FNN: Feedforward Neural Network

A concise feedforward neural network built from scratch in Python. Ideal for learning forward propagation and backpropagation.

## Features
- **Customizable Architecture:** Define layers, neurons, and activation functions.
- **Core Functionality:** Implements forward propagation and gradient descent-based backpropagation.
- **Modular Design:** Easy-to-read and extend.

## Installation

Clone the repository, set up a virtual environment, and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hvbhanot/FNN.git
cd FNN
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
pip install -r requirements.txt
